# cubepartyinvite.github.io
Relatively Simple way to participate to Cubeparty. Framework includes always needful loading animation that spins while loading resourses such as audio. There is also couple basic effects added. Framework uses heavily GSAP timeline for organizing different scenes and also animating components inside a effect.

Have Fun.
