CubeParty html file is the main configuration point for own productions. Add you own scripts to be loaded.

There are tags that provide more stable release candidates. Minor version number means that there are changes which probably breaks the compatibility and needs merging. Patch number should be quite small fix and hopefully doesn't break anything bigger.
